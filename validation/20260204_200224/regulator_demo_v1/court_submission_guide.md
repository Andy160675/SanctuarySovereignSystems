# Court Submission Guide: Procedural Evidence

## Admissibility Requirements
1. **Chain of Custody**: Evidence must be hash-chained.
2. **Zero Bias**: Evidence must have 0.0 emotional content.
3. **Temporal Continuity**: Timestamps must be cryptographically anchored.

## Submission Workflow
1. Extract evidence hash from ledger.
2. Run `evidence_verification_tool.py` against the scenario JSON.
3. Attach `constitutional_check_result` as procedural proof of violation.
