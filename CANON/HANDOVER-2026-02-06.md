# SOVEREIGN SYSTEM — SESSION HANDOVER — 2026-02-06

**Context:** Codex Sovereign Systems. Constitutional AI governance company. Dubai trust structure for IP, traded Ltd entity. Founder: Andy Jones.

## Canonical Organization
- **Andy Jones** — Founder & Executive
- **Steven Jones** — CEO / POA
- **Chris Bevan** — COO
- **Kelly Pawlett** — Tenerife GM
- **Tom Maher** — Programme Director

## Constitutional Triad (Invariants)
1. Prefer stopping to lying
2. Never optimise away the signal that tells you you're wrong
3. Preserve emergent pattern signal long enough to learn from it

## Infrastructure State
- **NAS:** UGREEN DXP4800 Plus at 192.168.4.114:9999 (UGOS Pro, Debian 12 underneath)
- **Docker:** Installed on NAS but service in ERROR state — needs restart via UGOS UI
- **DNS:** Working via NAS + 1.1.1.1 fallback. Port 53 closed on NAS — no resolver running yet
- **10GbE:** Tuned (buffers set, jumbo frames enabled).
- **Tailscale mesh:** Connecting Node-0 (UK) and Node-1 (Tenerife)
- **Secure cloud:** Tresorit Business (Swiss, zero-knowledge, E2E). account staging in `TRESORIT_STAGING`.

## Immediate Blockers (Human Hands Only)
1. NAS admin password — needs resetting via UGOS Control Panel before Docker can be fixed
2. Docker service restart on NAS after password resolved
3. Pi-hole deployment via UGOS Docker UI once service is running

## Constraints & Rules
- **Do NOT:** Request or use SSH root credentials in any AI session.
- **Do NOT:** Reference anyone named Owen — removed from org.
- **Do NOT:** Recommend Google Drive for anything.
- **Do NOT:** Build 13-agent deliberation for packet-level decisions.
- **Do NOT:** Produce scaffolding without proportional insight.
- **Rule:** Memory edits are canonical truth. Old chat history is artefact only. If in doubt, ask Andy.

## Documents Produced
- **CSS-ARCH-DOC-001 v1.0.0** — Sovereign Systems Architecture (pending Steven review)
- **CSS-GOV-DOC-002 v1.1.0** — Integrated Governance & Financial Framework (pending Steven review)
