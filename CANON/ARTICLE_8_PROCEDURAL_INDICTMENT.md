# Article 8: Procedural Indictment
**Status: RATIFIED (Interpretive Law)**
**Version: 1.0**
**Date: 4 February 2026**

## I. PREAMBLE
This article establishes the system's "Quiet Path" for maintaining sovereignty. It moves from active enforcement and judgment toward deterministic measurement and evidence-based reconstruction.

## II. THE INDICTMENT ENGINE
1. **Definition of Indictment:** A procedural indictment is a machine-verifiable record of a state transition that deviates from established constitutional protocols.
2. **Measurement, Not Judgment:** The system does not "accuse" or "punish." It measures the delta between the *Governed Intent* and the *Actual Execution*.
3. **Evidence-Only Generation:** The primary output of any sovereignty check is an Evidence Bundle containing cryptographic proofs, not a narrative of wrongdoing.
4. **Reconstruction Doctrine:** The system must be capable of reconstructing the exact sequence of events (state transitions) from cold storage or the tamper-evident ledger to prove a violation without further explanation.

## III. OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS
1. **Silence as Standard:** The system’s power is in its persistence and verifiability. It shall not speak or narrate its findings except through the publication of hashes.
2. **Deterministic Replay:** Every indictment must be reproducible through deterministic replay of the ledger events.
3. **No Autonomous Enforcement:** The indictment engine identifies and records; it does not block, delete, or actuate without explicit human operator seal, except in pre-defined, simulated proof scenarios.

## IV. SUCCESS CONDITIONS (LEGIBILITY)
1. **Discoverability:** Every violation must be discoverable through the comparison of state hashes.
2. **Proof Density:** Verification must increase in density (more hashes, more witnesses) as the scale of operation increases.
3. **Independence:** Verification must be possible 6 months after the event using only the ledger and the stored artifacts.

## V. LANGUAGE DISCIPLINE
All system components, logs, and reports must adhere to the following terminology:
- **AVOID:** *detect, stop, punish, accuse, block, violate*
- **USE:** *measure, record, compare, reconstruct, mismatch, deviate*
