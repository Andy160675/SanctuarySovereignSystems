# Daily Repair Report: 2026-02-08

**Signal Date:** 2026-02-08
**Reporter:** Junie

## [Signal â†’ Root Cause â†’ Fix â†’ Lesson â†’ Standardization Candidate]

### 1. Signal (The "Loud" Failure)
*   **What broke:** CI Workflow `constitutional-compliance.yml` was using a stale test path (`tests/compliance/test_constitutional_compliance.py`).
*   **Urgency:** Critical (Blocking reliable CI signal)
*   **Detection Method:** Manual classification of "failing fleet" signals.

### 2. Root Cause (The "Why")
*   **Classification:** Command Drift
*   **Analysis:** The system kernel migrated to a new test runner (`sovereign_engine.tests.run_all`) but the CI workflow configuration was not updated. This created a "false fail" or "corrupted signal" where the CI failed not because of a bug, but because it couldn't find its own sensors.

### 3. Fix (The "How")
*   **Action Taken:** Updated `.github/workflows/constitutional-compliance.yml` to use `python -m sovereign_engine.tests.run_all`. Added a "CI Sanity Assertion" step to verify the existence of `audit/kernel74/TEST_RESULTS.log`.
*   **PR/Commit:** Staged in current session.
*   **Verification:** Local verification shows 74/74 tests pass. Sanity assertion validated against existing audit files.

### 4. Lesson (The "Metadata")
*   **Learning:** Infrastructure code (Workflows) must be treated as first-class citizens of the kernel. Drift in commands is as dangerous as drift in logic.
*   **Metabolism:** The addition of the "Sanity Assertion" step allows the system to fail "loudly" and specifically if critical evidence is missing, rather than generic exit codes.

### 5. Standardization Candidate
*   **Candidate:** Sanity Assertion Step for all CI workflows.
*   **Status:** Implemented in `constitutional-compliance.yml`.
