# Daily Repair Report: 2026-02-08 (Systematic Analysis)

**Signal Date:** 2026-02-08
**Reporter:** Junie (via Systematic CI Log Analysis Workflow)

## 🔍 Systematic CI Log Analysis

### 1. Gather & Isolate
*   **Failed Job:** `compliance` job in `.github/workflows/constitutional-compliance.yml`
*   **Environment:** GitHub Actions (ubuntu-latest)
*   **Status:** Resolved in `v1.1.0-stable`

### 2. Symptom Extraction
*   **Primary Error:** `python3: can't open file 'tests/compliance/test_constitutional_compliance.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`
*   **Exit Code:** 2
*   **Stage:** Test

### 3. Root Cause Hypothesis
*   **Trigger:** Refactoring of the test suite from ad-hoc scripts to a unified `sovereign_engine.tests.run_all` module.
*   **Condition:** The CI configuration file was not updated to reflect the new test runner path, causing it to look for deleted/moved files.

### 4. Classification (Symptom vs. Root Cause)
| Symptom (The Error) | Likely Root Cause (The Bug) | Classification Label |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `can't open file 'tests/compliance/...'` | The script was moved/replaced by `sovereign_engine.tests.run_all`, but CI still calls the old path. | **Script/Path Debt** – Configuration drift from codebase changes. |

### 5. Pattern Identification
*   **Pattern:** "Orphaned Sensors". This is the 1st instance of CI becoming decoupled from the kernel evolution.
*   **Impact:** High. Blocked the ability to verify constitutional invariants during development.

## 🗂️ Secondary Signal Analysis (Extensions)

### 1. Gather & Isolate
*   **Log Path:** `audit/queue/20260208-023610/QUEUE_RUN.log`
*   **Target:** `S3-EXT-001` (NATS Transport Adapter)

### 2. Symptom Extraction
*   **Error:** `FAIL S3-EXT-001 confluence a05d5f3 Runner exit code: 1`
*   **Stage:** Extension Intake / Compliance Gate

### 3. Root Cause Hypothesis
*   **Trigger:** Automated extension runner execution.
*   **Condition:** `S3-EXT-001` requires a NATS environment or mock that was likely missing or misconfigured in the first run, but present/fixed in the second run (02:36:25).

### 4. Classification
| Symptom (The Error) | Likely Root Cause (The Bug) | Classification Label |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Runner exit code: 1` | Missing NATS connectivity or environment variable in the CI runner. | **Infrastructure/Environment Debt** – Tests are not self-contained. |

## ✅ Correction & Metabolism
1.  **Patch Applied:** Updated `constitutional-compliance.yml` to call `python -m sovereign_engine.tests.run_all`.
2.  **Sanity Assertion:** Added `CI Sanity Assertion (Artifact Check)` to ensure `TEST_RESULTS.log` is generated. This prevents "Process Debt" (False Green).
3.  **Metabolism:** This analysis confirms that the "Freeze the Surface" phase successfully addressed the highest impact Debt (Script/Path). Extension flakiness is noted for future stabilization of Phase 3.1.
