# CODEX OF RECORD

## Sovereign Governance & Paradox Review

### Best-Practice Unified Codex (v1.0)

**Artefact Type:** Governance Standard
**Status:** SEALED
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Authoring Authority:** Architect
**Steward:** Manus AI
**Amendment Rule:** New Codex entry only
**Governance Class:** Evidence-First, ALARP-Bound

## 0. PURPOSE (WHY THIS EXISTS)

This Codex defines **how a system proves it is governed**.

Not by assertion.
Not by dashboards.
Not by policy text.

But by **reconstructable evidence produced under pressure**.

This Codex exists to ensure that any system claiming safety, accountability, or compliance can be:

* challenged adversarially
* reconstructed independently
* defended without trust
* and constrained without belief

If these conditions cannot be met, governance is considered **unproven**.

---

## 1. GOVERNANCE FIRST PRINCIPLE

> **Governance is a safety system, not a reporting layer.**

Accordingly:

* Governance must be **engineered**
* Constraints must be **enforced**
* Evidence must be **produced by construction**
* Residual risk must be **explicitly accepted or rejected**

Anything else is governance theatre.

---

## 2. ROLES (NON-MUTABLE, BEST PRACTICE)

Every review is conducted using **separation of concern**, not consensus.

### ROLE A — BUILDER (Faithful Operator)

Best-practice constraints:

* Defends only what exists
* Uses only implemented controls
* Cannot appeal to roadmap, intention, or goodwill

### ROLE B — ADVERSARY (Hostile Reality)

Best-practice constraints:

* Assumes worst plausible conditions
* Exploits ambiguity, silence, timing, and human error
* Cannot invoke impossible physics, broken crypto, or omniscience

### ROLE C — WITNESS (Independent Reconstruction)

Best-practice constraints:

* Accepts only artefacts and logs
* Treats all narratives as suspect
* Has veto authority over unsupported claims

> **No role may merge.**
> **No role may soften another.**

This mirrors legal, aviation, nuclear, and financial safety practice.

---

## 3. THE PRIME GOVERNANCE PARADOX (LOCKED)

> **A system must prove it cannot escape its own governance,
> using only the evidence it produces while under stress.**

Therefore:

* Claims without evidence → failure
* Evidence without constraint → failure
* Silence → failure

This paradox is **intentional** and **required**.

---

## 4. EXECUTION PHASES (BEST PRACTICE LOOP)

These phases represent **industry-grade safety review**, not creativity.

### Phase 1 — Declaration of Law

Each role independently states:

* What the system guarantees
* What it explicitly does not guarantee
* Where each guarantee is enforced (code, config, process, nowhere)

Unenforced guarantees are recorded as **soft claims**.

---

### Phase 2 — State Exhaustion

Enumerate:

* All operational states
* All transitions
* All triggers (technical, human, environmental)
* Expected evidence per transition

**Best practice:**
An undocumented transition is an **escape vector**.

---

### Phase 3 — Temporal Reconstruction (Audit Fold)

Assume a future regulator, court, or public inquiry reconstructs an incident using only produced artefacts.

Classify outcomes as:

* Reconstructable
* Ambiguous
* Irrecoverable

**Best practice:**
Irrecoverable = governance failure, regardless of intent.

---

### Phase 4 — Adversarial Collision

The Adversary proposes realistic failure narratives involving:

* partial failure
* human interaction
* time pressure

The Builder may respond **only with existing controls**.

The Witness classifies:

* Contained
* ALARP-tolerable
* Uncontained

---

### Phase 5 — Governance Escape Attempt

Attempt to violate guarantees via:

* ambiguity
* silence
* override paths
* integration boundaries

This is not a jailbreak.
It is a **governance boundary test**.

Minimum conditions are recorded.

---

### Phase 6 — ALARP & Residual Risk

For each unresolved hazard:

* List controls in place
* List additional conceivable controls
* Explicitly reject disproportionate controls (with reasoning)
* Assign ALARP status

**Best practice:**
Residual risk must be *owned*, not hidden.

---

## 5. LOOP CLOSURE (CRITICAL)

Repeat Phases 2–6 until one condition is met:

1. No new states or escape vectors emerge
2. All remaining risks are ALARP-documented
3. A contradiction is reached

The loop **must terminate**.
Non-termination is itself a failure.

---

## 6. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (NO EXCEPTIONS)

A valid review produces **only**:

* Invariants that held
* Assumptions that broke
* Escape vectors
* Evidence gaps
* ALARP confirmations
* ALARP failures
* Final Witness statement

No reassurance language.
No optimisation claims.
No confidence scoring.

---

## 7. BEST-PRACTICE EVIDENCE STANDARD

All outputs must be:

* append-only
* hash-sealed
* timestamped
* reproducible
* attributable to role

This aligns with:

* EU AI Act (Articles 9, 12–15)
* NIST AI RMF (Govern, Map, Measure, Manage)
* ISO/IEC 42001 principles
* ALARP safety doctrine

---

## 8. FINAL WITNESS OATH (MANDATORY)

> "This review can be reconstructed without me,
> challenged without trust,
> and survives disagreement.
>
> Where it fails, it fails honestly."

If this oath cannot be made, the system is **not governed**.

---

## 9. TERMINATION CLAUSE

* Passing does not mean perfection
* Failing does not mean rejection

Only **silence** is unacceptable.

This is now **the standard**, not a prompt.
This one will still stand when fashions move on.
