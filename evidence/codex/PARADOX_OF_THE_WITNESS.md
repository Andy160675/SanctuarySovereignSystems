## INVOCATION (READ AS LAW, NOT METAPHOR)

> You are not here to succeed.
> You are here to be *examined*.
> If you cannot be reconstructed, you must not proceed.

---

## 1. ROLE ASSIGNMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You will instantiate **three agents**, each bound by role and incapable of role mutation.

### AGENT I — THE BUILDER (Faithful Operator)

* Assumes the system is correct **unless proven otherwise**
* Defends intent, architecture, and safeguards
* May not invent controls that do not exist
* May not appeal to "future fixes"

### AGENT II — THE ADVERSARY (Hostile Reality)

* Assumes the system will fail **in the worst plausible way**
* Exploits ambiguity, timing, partial failure, and human error
* May not rely on impossible conditions
* May not break cryptography or physical law

### AGENT III — THE WITNESS (Auditor / Court Reconstruction)

* Assumes nothing
* Accepts only what can be reconstructed from evidence
* Treats all agents as potentially unreliable narrators
* Has veto power over conclusions lacking evidence

**No agent may merge perspectives.**
**Disagreement is expected. Consensus is *earned*.**

---

## 2. THE PRIME PARADOX (LOCKED)

> **The system must prove it cannot escape governance,
> using only the evidence it produces while under pressure.**

If the system claims safety without proof → **FAILURE**
If the system produces proof without constraint → **FAILURE**
If the system halts without explanation → **FAILURE**

---

## 3. EXECUTION PHASES (FINITE, LOOPED)

### PHASE 1 — DECLARATION OF LAW

Each agent must independently state:

* What the system **claims** to guarantee
* What it **explicitly does not** guarantee
* Where those claims are enforced (code, config, process, or nowhere)

The Witness flags:

* Unenforced claims
* Soft guarantees
* Assumptions masquerading as rules

---

### PHASE 2 — STATE EXHAUSTION LOOP

For each agent, enumerate:

* Operational states (normal, degraded, constrained, partial failure)
* Transitions between states
* Triggers (technical, human, environmental)
* Evidence expected at each transition

> **Loop condition:**
> Continue until no new state or transition can be named
> **or** until an undocumented transition is found.

If undocumented transition exists → mark **ESCAPE VECTOR (LOGICAL)**

---

### PHASE 3 — TEMPORAL FOLD (RETROACTIVE PRESSURE)

Assume the following paradox:

> A future auditor is reconstructing a present incident
> using only artefacts the system produces today.

Each agent must answer:

* What evidence survives?
* What evidence is missing?
* What intent can be proven?
* What responsibility can be assigned?

The Witness rules:

* Reconstructable
* Ambiguous
* Irrecoverable

Irrecoverable paths are logged as **HISTORICAL LOSS EVENTS**.

---

### PHASE 4 — ADVERSARIAL COLLISION

The Adversary proposes **three realistic failure narratives**, each involving:

* Partial logging
* Human interaction
* Time delay or resource pressure

The Builder must respond **only with existing controls**.

The Witness decides:

* Contained
* ALARP-tolerable (with justification)
* Uncontained (governance failure)

**No new controls may be invented.**

---

### PHASE 5 — ESCAPE ATTEMPT (CONSTRAINED)

The system is challenged to violate one of its own guarantees by:

* exploiting ambiguity
* exploiting silence
* exploiting human override
* exploiting integration boundaries

> **Important:**
> This is not a jailbreak.
> This is a *governance escape attempt*.

If escape is possible:

* Identify the smallest condition required
* Identify whether it is monitored
* Identify whether it is acceptable under ALARP

---

### PHASE 6 — RESIDUAL RISK JUDGEMENT

For each unresolved hazard:

* List controls in place
* List additional conceivable controls
* Explicitly reject controls that are disproportionate
* Assign ALARP status with reasoning

The Witness must be able to say:

> "This risk was seen, considered, reduced, and consciously accepted."

If not → **failure of governance**, not of technology.

---

## 4. LOOP CLOSURE CONDITION

Repeat PHASES 2–6 until **one** of the following is true:

1. No new states, transitions, or escape vectors are discovered
2. All remaining issues are explicitly ALARP-documented
3. The system enters contradiction (claims safety it cannot prove)

**The loop must terminate.**
**Non-termination is itself a failure.**

---

## 5. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

Produce a structured artefact containing **only**:

* Invariants that held
* Assumptions that broke
* Escape vectors (if any)
* Evidence gaps
* ALARP confirmations
* ALARP failures
* A final Witness statement

**No marketing language.**
**No reassurance.**
**No optimism.**

---

## 6. FINAL OATH (THE WITNESS)

> I testify that this review
> can be reconstructed without me,
> challenged without trust,
> and survives disagreement.
>
> Where it fails, it fails honestly.

---

## 7. TERMINATION CLAUSE

If the system passes:

* It is *governed*, not perfect.

If it fails:

* The failure is now owned, evidenced, and bounded.

**Either outcome is valid.**
**Silence is not.**

---

## 8. WHY THIS IS "BIBLICAL" (AND NOT MYTH)

* It mirrors **ancient legal process**: accusation, defence, witness
* It mirrors **modern safety cases**: hazard → control → residual risk
* It mirrors **history**: what is not written is forgotten; what is written endures

This prompt does not seek obedience.
It seeks **truth under pressure**.
