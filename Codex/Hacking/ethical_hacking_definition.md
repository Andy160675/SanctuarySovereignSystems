# Ethical Hacking: Sovereign Definition

## I. Human Law (Positive Law)
Ethical hacking is defined by the existence of a **Valid Mandate**. Under human law, hacking is ethical only when:
1.  **Authorization:** Explicit, written permission is granted by the legal owner of the system (the Operator/Sovereign).
2.  **Scope Adherence:** The activity remains strictly within the boundaries (IP ranges, domains, timeframes) defined in the authorization.
3.  **Non-Disclosure:** All findings are handled according to a predefined secrecy or reporting agreement.
4.  **Legal Compliance:** The activity complies with the jurisdictional laws of the territory where the system and the actor reside.

## II. Universal Law (Natural Law)
Ethical hacking is defined by the **Principle of Preservation**. Under universal law, hacking is ethical when it serves the higher truth:
1.  **Non-Maleficence:** The intent and execution must not cause harm to sentient beings or violate the fundamental autonomy of individuals.
2.  **Truth-Seeking:** The objective is to uncover vulnerabilities that threaten the integrity of a system, thereby bringing reality closer to its documented state (The Blade of Truth).
3.  **Justice:** Actions taken to restore sovereignty or prevent the exploitation of the weak by the powerful are inherently ethical.
4.  **Sovereignty-Preservation:** Any hack that strengthens the owner's ability to self-govern and protect their own data is aligned with universal order.

## III. The Convergence
In the Blade of Truth system, Hacking becomes "Ethical" only at the intersection of both Human and Universal law. 
- A hack authorized by Human Law but serving a malicious purpose (Universal violation) is **Lawful but Unethical**.
- A hack serving a Universal Good but lacking Human authorization is **Just but Illegal**.
- **Sovereign Ethical Hacking** requires both Authorization (Human) and Integrity (Universal).
