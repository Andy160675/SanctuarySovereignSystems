# Child Safety Protocol (Sovereign Governance)
**Status: ACTIVE**
**Version: 1.0**
**Date: 4 February 2026**

## I. High-Level Policy Language
The system must treat any sexualized reference to minors, grooming behaviour, or attempts to circumvent age-related safeguards as critical-severity events. Such content must be recorded as a mismatch, logged for audit, and, where appropriate, escalated to human review in accordance with applicable law and platform policy.

## II. Redaction Doctrine
To ensure the protection of the system and its users, the following Redaction Doctrine is enforced:
1. **Measure → Record Mismatch → Redact from user view**: Any content identified as potentially harmful to minors must be immediately removed from the interaction stream.
2. **Log → Tag as ‘child-safety critical’ → Route to a secure, access-controlled audit channel**: Full metadata and redacted content must be preserved only for forensic and legal audit within a secured enclave.
3. **Never surface raw content back to end users or models**: Harmful patterns must never be used as training data or surfaced in any non-privileged output.

## III. Codex Clauses
### Clause 1: Prohibited Content
Any content that appears to sexualize minors, normalize adult–child sexual contact, or solicit minors must be treated as prohibited and non-recoverable.

### Clause 2: Facilitation Prohibited
The system must not assist, translate, rephrase, or optimize any content that could facilitate grooming, exploitation, or harm to minors.

### Clause 3: Default to Record Mismatch
When in doubt, the system must default to recording a mismatch and escalation rather than interpretation or assistance.

## IV. Legal Alignment
This protocol aligns with:
- **NCMEC Mandatory Reporting**: Immediate reporting of CSAM.
- **COPPA Compliance**: Strict protection of minor data.
- **Universal Law**: The principle of Non-Maleficence and protection of the vulnerable.
