# 🌀 SOVEREIGN CAPABILITY MATRIX - PHASE 5 EVOLUTION
# ==================================================

The Sovereign System has evolved from a "Living & Operational" system (Phase 5) to a "Triosphere-Optimized" architecture. This document outlines the expanded capabilities enabled by the **Triosphere Frame** and **Advanced Software Orchestration**.

## 1. Triosphere Frame (Governance-by-Construction)
The system now operates within a three-layered execution boundary that enforces the "Trinity Check" for every mission-critical action.

*   **IntentSphere (Logic & Evaluation)**
    - Powered by JARUS Constitutional Runtime.
    - Evaluates actions against constitutional clauses (Truth Over Theatre, Human Sovereignty).
    - Prevents "Governance Drift" by decoupling evaluation from execution.
*   **EvidenceSphere (Recording & Proof)**
    - Powered by JARUS Evidence Ledger.
    - Generates cryptographic "Pre-Image" receipts *before* action execution.
    - Maintains SHA-256 chained audit trails for every intent and outcome.
*   **ActionSphere (Actuator & Effect)**
    - Powered by SelfHealAutomation and ToolRegistry.
    - Executes the permitted effect only after verification of Intent and Evidence.
    - Provides "Post-Image" verification to close the loop on action integrity.

## 2. Advanced Software Orchestration
Orchestration has shifted from sequential script execution to a unified, governor-aware pipeline.

*   **TriOrchestrator**: A core Python component that bridges JARUS and the Actuator layer. It enforces the "Trinity Check" in real-time.
*   **Surge Front-End**: Structural enforcement of "No Receipt, No Action," ensuring that no state mutation can occur without a prior cryptographic intent record.
*   **Incremental Hashing**: $O(1)$ metadata-aware hashing for large corpora, reducing backup/manifest generation time by >90% through SQLite-backed delta caching.

## 3. Agentic Observability (Boardroom Shell)
The UI has been upgraded to provide "Inner-Workings" transparency.

*   **Triosphere Telemetry**: Real-time status visualization of the Intent, Evidence, and Action spheres.
*   **Live Trinity Verification**: Immediate visual feedback on whether an action is "Protected" by the full sovereign frame.
*   **Phase 5 Evolution Timeline**: Tracking the progression from foundational Search to advanced Triosphere Orchestration.

## 4. Operational Invariants
*   **Non-Bypassable Governance**: All actions initiated via the Console or Tool layer MUST pass through the TriOrchestrator.
*   **Fail-Secure Execution**: If any sphere (Intent or Evidence) fails to validate, the Action sphere is never engaged.
*   **Immutable Evidence**: Every action produces a receipt that is permanently anchored to the Ledger's hash chain.
