# Phase 1: Supervised Operations
# ===============================
# With determinism proven, the system can begin supervised operations
# under human-in-the-loop governance.

phase: 1
name: "Supervised Operations"
description: |
  Phase 1 allows the Trinity agents to operate under supervision.
  All missions require human approval before execution. Policy gate
  enforces governance. Actuators can be deployed but require manual approval.
