# Phase 3: Autonomous Operations
# ===============================
# With semi-autonomous operations proven, the system can execute
# LOW and MEDIUM risk missions autonomously.

phase: 3
name: "Autonomous Operations"
description: |
  Phase 3 allows automatic execution of LOW and MEDIUM risk missions.
  HIGH risk missions still require human approval. The feedback loop
  is active and the system learns from its operations.
