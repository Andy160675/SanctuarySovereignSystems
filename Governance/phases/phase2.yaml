# Phase 2: Semi-Autonomous Operations
# ====================================
# With supervised operations proven, the system can begin semi-autonomous
# execution of low-risk missions.

phase: 2
name: "Semi-Autonomous Operations"
description: |
  Phase 2 allows automatic execution of LOW risk missions. MEDIUM and HIGH
  risk missions still require human approval. Actuators can auto-register
  but require health validation.

entry_requirements:
  - phase_1_exit_tests_passed
  - minimum_50_supervised_missions
  - board_approval_phase_2

automated_exit_tests:
  - auto_execution_low_risk_test
  - risk_gating_enforcement_test
  - circuit_breaker_test
  - anomaly_detection_test

human_exit_conditions:
  - "100 successful semi-autonomous missions"
  - "Circuit breaker triggered and recovered at least once"
  - "Board review of Phase 2 operations"

allowed_capabilities:
  - all_phase_1_capabilities
  - auto_execute_low_risk
  - actuator_auto_registration
  - anomaly_detection
  - circuit_breaker

forbidden_capabilities:
  - auto_execute_medium_risk
  - auto_execute_high_risk
  - model_training
  - dynamic_policy_modification_without_supermajority

claims_allowed:
  - "Low-risk missions execute automatically"
  - "Circuit breaker protects against cascading failures"
  - "Anomaly detection surfaces irregular patterns"
