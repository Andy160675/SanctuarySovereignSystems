# Phase 8: AGI Integration & Road 1234
# =====================================
# The system enters high-autonomy operations with AGI integration
# and automated PDCA optimization loops.

phase: 8
name: "AGI Integration & Road 1234"
description: |
  Phase 8 represents the transition to high-autonomy operations.
  The system is capable of self-directed optimization via Road 1234
  and integrates Governed AGI artifacts for complex reasoning.
