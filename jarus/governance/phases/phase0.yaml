# Phase 0: Foundation & Determinism
# =================================
# The system must prove it can boot, produce deterministic outputs,
# and maintain ledger integrity before any advanced features are allowed.

phase: 0
name: "Foundation & Determinism"
description: |
  Phase 0 establishes the baseline: atomic boot, deterministic decision-making,
  and immutable audit trail. No autonomous agents, no model training, no
  production writes from AI. This is the "prove you can walk before you run" phase.
