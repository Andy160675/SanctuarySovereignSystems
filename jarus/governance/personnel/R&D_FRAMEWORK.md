# R&D FRAMEWORK — Southampton University Partnership

## Overview
This document defines the research and development framework for the Aegis Governance Orchestrator, led by Steven (CEO) in partnership with Southampton University.

## Research Focus
**Topic:** Efficacy of school administration and its burden on teachers.
**Goal:** Deploying the Aegis system as a regulatory framework across Hampshire to reduce administrative overhead and return resources to frontline teaching.

## Key Objectives
1. **Admin Burden Reduction:** Quantifying and minimizing the time teachers spend on non-teaching administrative tasks.
2. **Regulatory Deployment:** Implementing Aegis as the governing layer for school processes in Hampshire.
3. **Evidence Generation:** Collecting machine-verifiable proof of efficiency gains.
4. **Asset Strategy:** Evaluating the viability of creating a group-owned school if research proves the framework's effectiveness.

## Partner: Southampton University
- **Role:** Academic validation and research methodology support.
- **Engagement:** Direct collaboration with the R&D lead (Steven).

## Business Model Integration
- **Stream:** R&D / Investment
- **Metric of Success:** Less Admin → More Teachers (Resources diverted from government overhead to educational delivery).
- **Contingent Outcome:** Creation of a Sovereign School model.

## Governance Integration
The R&D framework operates under the Aegis Constitutional Control Plane. All research findings and deployment decisions must be logged in the Evidence Ledger.
