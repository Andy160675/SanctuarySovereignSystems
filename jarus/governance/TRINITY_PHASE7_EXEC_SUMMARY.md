# Executive Summary: Trinity Phase 7 Deployment

## 1. Objective
Establish a cryptographically-sealed, balanced agent architecture ("Trinity") across The Blade of Truth fleet to ensure deterministic governance and operational sovereignty.

## 2. Key Achievements
- **Standardized Architecture**: Every node now runs exactly 3 agents: Investigator, Verifier, and Guardian.
- **Hardened Orchestration**: The `orchestrate_fleet.ps1` interface is now precision-controlled with deterministic manifest generation.
- **Sealed Integrity**: The system state has been baselined and sealed with a repository manifest.

## 3. Verification State
- **Phase**: 7 (Fleet Orchestration)
- **Status**: SEALED
- **Trinity Alignment**: 100% (3/3 agents on all nodes)
- **Refusal Rate**: 0.00%

## 4. Verification Steps
Stakeholders can verify the system state using the following command:
```powershell
.\scripts\fleet\orchestrate_fleet.ps1 -Action Verify
```
