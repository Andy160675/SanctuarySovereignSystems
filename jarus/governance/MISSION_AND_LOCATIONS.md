## 2. Business Mission: Community Real Estate & Development
We are a real estate and property development company, but with a fundamental shift in purpose: **we develop for the community.**

### A. Level Playing Fields
*   Our "Business Acumen" is applied to ensure that development benefits the many, not just the few.

As codified in `STRATEGIC_MARKET_ALIGNMENT.md`, 20% of net cash profit is remitted to community projects.
*   The Rhondda and its inhabitants are the primary beneficiaries of this commitment.
*   Funding will be prioritized for local infrastructure, social enterprises, and historical preservation in the Rhondda.

## 3. Sovereign Charter Integration
