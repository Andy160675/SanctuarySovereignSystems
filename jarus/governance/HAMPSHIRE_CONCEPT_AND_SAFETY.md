# Hampshire Transition: Research & Safety Framework

## Purpose
This document provides the canonical framing for the transition from the Isle of Wight research exercise to the Hampshire regulatory deployment discovery. It ensures all communications are board-safe, governance-aligned, and risk-mitigated.

## The Isle of Wight Precedent
When describing previous work, use this exact framing:
> “We previously ran a **staff-facing research and search exercise** in a contained local-authority context (Isle of Wight). The purpose was to help staff **locate policy, guidance, and evidence faster**, reduce duplicated admin, and **improve confidence during audits and inspections**.
> It was **non-student-facing**, **non-decision-making**, and exploratory.”

## Approved Response Templates
If asked “have you done this before?”, use **one** of these sentences:
1. “We’ve explored a staff research/search capability before in a contained authority setting, focused purely on admin and compliance support.”
2. “Yes—previously as a research exercise to help staff find policies and evidence quickly, not to automate decisions.”
3. “Only at a discovery level, and only for staff workflows. Nothing pupil-facing.”

## The Hampshire Bridge
When discussing Hampshire deployment:
> “We’re not proposing a rollout. We’re simply validating whether **similar administrative pressures** exist here, and whether a research/search approach would be useful.”

## Funding & Social Alignment (Disadvantaged Children)
If disadvantaged-children funding is raised, the **only acceptable linkage** is:
> “Reducing admin load in high-deprivation settings so staff time is freed for pupils who need it most—while strengthening safeguarding evidence.”

**CRITICAL:** Never say the tech is *for* disadvantaged children. It supports **adults working in those environments**.

## 1) 90-Second Spoken Brief (for Steven)
This is designed to be **memorised** and delivered calmly.

> “We’re not proposing a rollout or a new system.
>
> We previously ran a **staff-facing research and search exercise** in a contained authority context to help staff find policy, guidance, and safeguarding evidence faster. It wasn’t pupil-facing and didn’t automate decisions.
>
> What we’re doing now is simply **listening** to understand whether similar administrative and compliance pressures exist here — particularly around safeguarding paperwork, inspection readiness, and duplicated admin.
>
> In higher-deprivation settings, those burdens tend to be heavier. If staff spend less time chasing evidence, they have more time for pupils — without the system ever touching pupils or making judgements.
>
> This is research only. Humans remain accountable. If there’s no value, we stop.”

**Stop talking there.**
If questions come, answer narrowly.

## 2) One-Page Funding-Alignment Note (Non-Technical)
You can hand this to a funder, LA officer, or trust lead.

### Research Alignment Note: Administrative & Safeguarding Capacity

**Context**
Schools in high-deprivation areas face disproportionate administrative and safeguarding compliance burdens, alongside increased inspection and audit pressure.

**Problem**
* Significant staff time spent locating policies, guidance, and historical evidence
* Duplicated admin across systems
* High stress around inspections and safeguarding reviews
* Burnout risk in already stretched environments

**Proposed Research Focus (Discovery Only)**
* Staff-facing research/search capability
* Policy and guidance navigation
* Safeguarding evidence collation and traceability
* Reduction of duplicated administrative work

**What This Is Not**
* Not pupil-facing
* Not decision-making
* Not risk scoring or prediction
* Not automation of safeguarding judgements

**Equity Rationale**
By reducing administrative load in high-deprivation settings, staff capacity is freed for direct educational and pastoral work, while safeguarding compliance is strengthened.

**Safeguards**
* Human oversight at all times
* Research phase only
* Fully reversible
* Local authority visibility

**Status**
Exploratory research and problem validation only. No deployment proposed.

## 3) Red-Flag Language Card (Keep this visible)
Steven should **actively avoid** these phrases.

### ❌ Do NOT say
* “AI for disadvantaged children”
* “Predictive safeguarding”
* “Automated risk detection”
* “Optimising pupil outcomes”
* “Decision support for safeguarding”

### ✅ Say instead
* “Staff-facing research and search”
* “Administrative burden reduction”
* “Safeguarding evidence handling”
* “Audit and inspection readiness”
* “Human-led, compliance-supporting workflows”

If someone else uses red-flag language, Steven should **correct it immediately**.

## Strategic Boundaries
*   Research/search only.
*   Staff-facing only.
*   Evidence navigation, not judgement.
*   Human accountability everywhere.
