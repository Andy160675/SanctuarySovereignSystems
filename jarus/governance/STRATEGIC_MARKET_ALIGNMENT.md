# STRATEGIC MARKET ALIGNMENT — Path to Sovereignty

## Objective
To establish a sustainable, tamper-evident business model that protects Intellectual Property (IP), secures diversified funding (Grants + Private Investment), and maintains a 20% commitment to community projects.

## 1. Optimal Business Structure: The Dual-Entity Hybrid
We will employ a **Parent Foundation / Operating Subsidiary** model.

### A. The Foundation (NFP — Non-Profit)
*   **Role:** Custodian of the "Sovereign Core" IP and Community Mandate.
*   **Jurisdiction:** Singapore (Public Company Limited by Guarantee) or Switzerland (Foundation).
*   **Purpose:** Secure grants, hold core IP, and oversee the 20% community profit distribution.
*   **Funding:** Public research grants, private philanthropic donations, and licensing fees from the FP subsidiary.

### B. The Operator (FP — For-Profit)
*   **Role:** Commercialization, product development, and market scaling.
*   **Jurisdiction:** Singapore (Private Limited) or USA (Delaware Public Benefit Corporation - PBC).
*   **Purpose:** Revenue generation, private investment (VC), and operational excellence.
*   **Sovereign Link:** Bound by the "Sovereign Charter" to remit 20% of net cash profit to the Foundation for community projects.

## 2. Jurisdiction Selection: Singapore (Global Lead)
**Primary Choice: Singapore**
*   **Support:** Strong support for both Tech Startups (SGInnovate) and NFPs.
*   **Benefits:** Favorable tax regime, robust IP protection laws, and "Sandbox" regulatory environments for fintech/governance tech.
*   **Profit/NFP Balance:** Singapore allows for a seamless "Social Enterprise" setup where for-profit entities can be certified for their social impact.

**Secondary Choice: Switzerland (Crypto/Governance Valley)**
*   **Benefits:** Maximum IP sovereignty and neutrality. High trust for NFP foundations.

## 3. IP Protection Strategy: "Guardian Licensing"
*   **Core Sovereignty IP:** Owned exclusively by the NFP Foundation.
*   **Commercial License:** The FP Subsidiary is granted an exclusive, revocable-on-breach license to commercialize the IP.
*   **Tamper-Evidence:** All IP licensing and versioning are logged to the `decision_ledger.jsonl` to prevent unauthorized "IP stripping" during investment rounds.

## 4. Revenue & 20% Community Commitment
*   **Revenue Streams:** SaaS subscriptions, Enterprise Support, and Sovereign Node hardware/hosting.
*   **The 20% Rule:** 20% of net cash profit (after tax and essential R&D) is automatically allocated to community projects via the Foundation.
*   **Verification:** This rule is enforced by the "Machine-Checked Law" in `AUTONOMY_LIMITS.md`.

## 5. Path to Market
1.  **Phase 0 (Current):** Secure IP via hash-chained manifests and local sovereignty proofs.
2.  **Phase 1 (Setup):** Incorporate the Singapore Foundation (NFP).
3.  **Phase 2 (Capital):** Apply for initial grants via the Foundation while opening a Seed Round for the FP subsidiary.
4.  **Phase 3 (Scale):** Launch the first commercial "Sovereign Node" service.
