## SLIDE 0 – ONE-PAGER / COVER

**Visual:** Factory silhouette (left) + AI/data network (right)

> We are building a governed AI co-pilot for operational decision-making in complex environments such as manufacturing.
>
> The system ingests the organisation's existing data – logs, reports, SOPs, emails and metrics – and uses a governed reasoning engine to generate explanations, recommendations and risk assessments.
>
> Every output comes with a traceable evidence trail: which data was used, what assumptions were made, and how the conclusion was reached.
>
> The result is not another chatbot, but an auditable decision-support layer that can sit alongside existing systems, helping teams understand problems faster, test the impact of proposed changes and document their reasoning for customers, auditors and insurers.

## SLIDE 1 – TITLE & POSITIONING

**Visual:** Wordmark "Sovereign AI Co-Pilot" + co-pilot icon, subtle upward line graph

**Title:** Sovereign AI Co-Pilot – Project Presentation

**Subtitle:** Evidence-first, governance-ready decision support for manufacturing and beyond

- Converts scattered operational data into explainable recommendations
- Designed for regulated, audit-sensitive environments
- Built to run in the customer's own environment, under their control

---

## SLIDE 2 – THE PROBLEM & OPPORTUNITY

**Visual (Figure 1):** Bar chart – "Cost of Unstructured Decisions (Illustrative)"
- Downtime: £500k
- Rework: £300k
- Supplier Disruptions: £200k
- Audit Friction: £150k

**Title:** The Problem We Are Addressing

**Challenges:**
- Critical decisions rely on scattered data (logs, emails, spreadsheets, PDFs)
- Root-cause analysis is slow, inconsistent and person-dependent
- Change decisions are made with partial visibility of knock-on effects
- Supplier and batch risks are often detected too late
- Audit and customer assurance demand manual reconstruction of the decision trail

**Opportunity:**
- Faster, more consistent decisions → less downtime, rework and waste
- Transparent reasoning → stronger trust with customers and regulators
- Structured decision trails → reduced audit cost and legal exposure

## SLIDE 3 – WHAT WE'VE BUILT

**Visual (Figure 2):** Flow diagram: Data → Evidence & Integrity → Governed Reasoning → Use-Case Apps → Audit Trail

**Title:** What We've Built

- A governed AI engine that reads and reasons over existing organisational data:
  - Logs, SOPs, incident reports, emails, KPIs and sensor data

- An evidence and integrity layer that:
  - Hashes and timestamps inputs
  - Links each answer to the exact data behind it

- A set of focused applications (UIs) on top of the engine:
  - Downtime triage
  - Change impact analysis
  - Supplier / Quality Risk Radar

- An audit trail for every interaction, exportable to:
  - PDF, Excel or JSON for internal and external review

## SLIDE 4 – SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

**Visual (Figure 3):** 5-layer horizontal stack

**Title:** System Architecture – Key Components

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Data Ingestion** | Sensors, databases, files and APIs feeding data into the system |
| **Evidence Layer** | Data transformation, validation and evidence storage; hashes and timestamps applied |
| **Governed Reasoning Engine** | Multi-agent AI that generates, checks and constrains answers according to policy |
| **Applications (UIs)** | Role-specific interfaces for engineers, operations, quality and supply chain |
| **Audit & Reporting** | Decision logs, evidence links and reports for QA, compliance and customers |

---

## SLIDE 5 – HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM GENERIC AI

**Visual (Figure 4):** Two-column comparison table

**Title:** How This Differs from Generic AI

| Typical AI Tools | Sovereign AI Co-Pilot |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Stateless chats with weak memory of context | Grounded in the organisation's own data and history |
| No guaranteed record of which data was used | Full audit trail of data sources and key transformations |
| Limited or no explainability | Transparent reasoning: shows assumptions and confidence levels |
| Usually cloud-hosted, harder to run on-premises | Runs inside the customer's environment (on-prem or private cloud) |
| Prone to "hallucinations" and inconsistent outputs | Built for accountable decisions, not just conversational assistance |

---

## SLIDE 6 – USE CASE 1: DOWNTIME TRIAGE

**Visual (Figure 5):** UI mock (left) + bar chart "Average Time to Diagnose Root Cause" (right)
- Before: 8 hours
- After: 3 hours (≈60% reduction) *Illustrative*

**Title:** Use Case 1: Downtime Triage

**Scenario:** A manufacturing line experiences recurring stoppages and failures.

**Process:**
1. The system ingests sensor data, machine logs and operator notes
2. It clusters similar incidents and surfaces likely root-cause patterns
3. For each cluster, it proposes probable causes and recommended next actions
4. Engineers review the evidence and act with full context

**Business impact (illustrative):**
- ~60% reduction in average time to diagnose root cause
- Fewer repeat incidents due to consistent corrective actions
- Clear documentation of how each conclusion was reached

---

## SLIDE 7 – USE CASE 2: CHANGE IMPACT ADVISOR

**Visual (Figure 6):** Timeline of past changes (left) + impact grid colour-coded by risk (right)

**Title:** Use Case 2: Change Impact Advisor

**Scenario:** A team wants to increase line speed or change a material.

**Process:**
1. The proposed change is described in natural language
2. The system scans SOPs, incidents, change logs and KPIs
3. It surfaces similar past changes and their outcomes
4. It highlights impacted areas (process steps, teams, metrics)
5. It suggests a monitoring plan and a risk level (Low / Medium / High)

**Business impact (illustrative):**
- Reduced likelihood of unintended side-effects from changes
- Faster preparation of change-control documents
- Better alignment between operations, quality and management

---

## SLIDE 8 – USE CASE 3: SUPPLIER / QUALITY RISK RADAR

**Visual (Figure 7):** Risk heatmap – suppliers (Y-axis) × time/batch (X-axis), green → amber → red

**Title:** Use Case 3: Supplier / Quality Risk Radar

**Scenario:** Supply chain and quality teams need to see where risk is building.

**Process:**
1. The system combines delivery performance, defect rates, complaints and external factors
2. It assigns risk scores to suppliers and active batches
3. It highlights outliers and emerging trends
4. Users click into a supplier or batch to see evidence and drivers

**Business impact (illustrative):**
- Earlier detection of high-risk suppliers or batches
- Reduced disruption and recalls
- Stronger basis for supplier reviews and negotiations

## SLIDE 9 – VALUE & ROI SNAPSHOT

**Visual (Figure 8):** Stacked bar "Illustrative Annual Value Potential per Site" + assumptions table

**Title:** Value & ROI – Illustrative Example

**Assumptions (customise per client):**
- Plant downtime cost: £10,000 per hour
- Current downtime: 200 hours/year → £2,000,000
- Conservative downtime reduction: 15–25%

**Illustrative benefits:**

| Source | Annual Value |
|--------|-------------|
| Downtime reduction (20% of £2m) | £400,000 |
| Reduced rework/scrap | £150,000 |
| Improved supplier risk management | £100,000 |
| Reduced audit preparation time | £50,000 |
| **Total** | **≈£700,000/year** |

*For a single medium-sized site. Numbers are illustrative.*
