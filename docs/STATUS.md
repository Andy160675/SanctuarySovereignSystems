# System Status

## Current State
- Season 2: CLOSED (Kernel sealed)
- Season 3: ACTIVE (Governance Phase)
- Kernel Tag: 1.0.0-kernel74 
- Validation: 74/74 invariants passed

## Build / Governance
- Build/Test: COMPLETE
- Extension Intake: OPEN (via ROADMAP + compliance gate)
- Protected Principle: Season 3 cannot alter Season 2 invariants

## Next Actions
1. Accept Season 3 PRs against extension IDs (S3-EXT-001..006)
2. Enforce traceability: requirement -> code -> test -> evidence
3. Reject any invariant-touching change paths
