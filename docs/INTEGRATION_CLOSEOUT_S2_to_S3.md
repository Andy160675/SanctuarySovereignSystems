# CSS-BUILD-DOC-001: INTEGRATION_CLOSEOUT_S2_to_S3
## Build & Test Evidence Record

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-08
**Baseline:** `v1.0.0-kernel74` (`1e23074b5d469524c479666a3068e54d6f4c63d8`)
**Seal Hash:** `36dd28e05440ae17b469ad05a5a71b7c3c35a164`

### 1. Invariant Verification Results
The full kernel test suite was executed against the baseline.

| Phase | Description | Result |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| P0 | Constitutional Ground Truth | 9/9 PASS |
| P1 | Typed Signal Substrate | 11/11 PASS |
| P2 | Router & Authority Kernel | 8/8 PASS |
| P3 | Legality Gate | 9/9 PASS |
| P4 | Audit Ledger | 6/6 PASS |
| P5 | Timing & Halt | 4/4 PASS |
| P6 | Failure Semantics | 4/4 PASS |
| P7 | Configurator | 5/5 PASS |
| P8 | Full Engine | 10/10 PASS |
| P9 | Extension Scaffold | 5/5 PASS |
| ADV | Adversarial Scenarios | 3/3 PASS |
| **TOTAL** | | **74/74 PASS** |

### 2. Autonomous Stress Test (PDCA-100)
A 100-cycle autonomous optimization loop was executed to verify sustained sovereignty.

- **Signals Processed:** 600
- **Authority Transitions:** 600
- **Halt Events:** 0 (Nominal)
- **Ledger Integrity:** 100% verified (SHA-256 chain intact)
- **Agent Orchestration:** 13 specialized agents successfully rotated through Trinity tiers.

### 3. Structural Seal Confirmation
- [x] `constitution.json` schema validated and locked.
- [x] `CODEOWNERS` path-level protection enacted.
- [x] `SEASONS.md` boundary definitions confirmed.

### 4. Conclusion
The Sovereign Recursion Engine is verified as stable, deterministic, and constitutionally aligned. The kernel is now sealed.
