# Sovereign Machine - V4 Charter

Status: Active Lineage
Predecessor: V3.0.0-COMPLETE (Frozen)
Date: 2025-11-26

## Purpose of V4

V4 exists to evolve the sovereign machine **without altering the integrity, guarantees, or historical truth of V3**.

V3 is the first institutional release; V4 is the first evolutionary line.

## What V4 is allowed to change

V4 may introduce:

- New capabilities that extend the organism
- New external integrations (RFC3161 live mode, IPFS live mode, etc.)
- New operator ergonomics (heartbeat, verify-now, cockpit lenses)
- New analytical or introspective layers
- New automation pipelines
- New avatar-level or role-level instrumentation
- New forms of evidence packaging or export

These are **forward-facing enhancements**.

## What V4 must never change

V4 must not:

- Rewrite or alter any V3 artifacts
- Modify the V3 audit chain
- Change the semantics of V3 governance decisions
- Mutate V3 evidence bundles
- Retroactively alter V3 logic, behavior, or guarantees
- Break reproducibility of V3 sessions
- Introduce ambiguity about what happened in V3

V3 is **frozen law**.
V4 is **new legislation**, not amendments to old statutes.

## Definition of Done for V4

V4 is considered complete when:

1. The machine gains at least one **externally verifiable capability** beyond V3
2. Operator ergonomics reach a new stable plateau
3. No V3 guarantees are violated
4. The system remains fully reconstructable and auditable
5. A new release capsule can be minted without touching V3

## Narrative Position

- V3: Institution achieved
- V4: Institution evolves
