## [Signal â†’ Root Cause â†’ Fix â†’ Lesson â†’ Standardization Candidate]

### 1. Signal (The "Loud" Failure)
*   **What broke:** (e.g., CI failure, artifact missing, drift detected)
*   **Urgency:** (Normal / Critical)
*   **Detection Method:** (Automated CI / Manual Check / User Report)

### 2. Root Cause (The "Why")
*   **Classification:** (Command Drift / Logic Error / Environment Issue / Documentation Gap)
*   **Analysis:** (Explain why the signal was delayed or corrupted, not just what failed.)

### 3. Fix (The "How")
*   **Action Taken:** (Describe the code/config changes)
*   **PR/Commit:** (Reference)
*   **Verification:** (Deterministic result, e.g., 3/3 passes)

### 4. Lesson (The "Metadata")
*   **Learning:** (What did we learn about the system's resilience?)
*   **Metabolism:** (How does this failure teach the system to be better?)

### 5. Standardization Candidate
*   **Candidate:** (Should this fix be part of the core kernel or a new CI assertion?)
*   **Status:** (Draft / Proposed / Implemented)
