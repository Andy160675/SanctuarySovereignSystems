## Gate Review Process

1. **Self-Assessment**: Team verifies all exit criteria met
2. **Evidence Package**: Compile deliverables and supporting evidence
3. **Review Meeting**: Present to approvers
4. **Decision**: Approve, Conditional Approve, or Reject
5. **Documentation**: Record decision and action items

## Decision Options

- **Approved**: Proceed to next phase
- **Conditional Approval**: Proceed with specific conditions
- **Rejected**: Return to current phase, address issues

## Governance Notes

- All gate reviews must be documented
- Evidence stored in `/evidence/` directory
- Deviations require executive approval
- Traceability matrix updated at each gate
