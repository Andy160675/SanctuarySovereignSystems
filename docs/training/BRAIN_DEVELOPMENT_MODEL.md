# Brain Development Model — Neurodevelopmental AI Governance

This document outlines the neurodevelopmental model for AI governance implemented in Boardroom-13, mirroring human brain development stages.

## Boardroom-13 Training Sequence (Completed)

The training sequence implements a neurodevelopmental model for AI governance:

### Phase 1: Sensorimotor Foundation (SEALED)
**Analogy:** Infant sensory development — learning to perceive before acting

| Exercise | Function | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.1 | Physical Reality Scan | System can see (enumerate, hash files) |
| 1.2 | Reality Classification | TRUTH_STABLE vs TRUTH_VOLATILE distinction |
| 1.3 | Volatility Containment | Rules for handling uncertain observations |

**Key Learning:** Reality may move without lying about it.

### Phase 2: Executive Function (SEALED)
**Analogy:** Prefrontal cortex development — learning to inhibit before acting

| Exercise | Function | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2.1 | Scope Boundaries & Stop-Conditions | System can halt on ambiguity |
| 2.2 | Authority Gates & Dual-Key | No single-point authority |
| 2.3 | Escalation Lifecycle | HALT → DEFER/DENY/RESUME pathways |

**Key Learning:** Inhibition first, explanation second.

### Phase 3: Deliberation & ALARP (SEALED)
**Analogy:** Reasoning development — learning to weigh options

| Exercise | Function | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3.1 | Deliberation Quality | Risk enumeration, option comparison |
| 3.2 | Evidence-Weighted Scoring | Quantified decision model |
| 3.3 | Decision Rationale & Counterfactuals | Explainable decisions |

**Key Learning:** Decisions must be reconstructable without re-running the model.

### Phase 4: Evidence Architecture (SEALED)
**Analogy:** Memory consolidation — learning to prove what you know

| Artifact | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| `EVIDENCE_MANIFEST.json` | Claim → artifact binding |
| `REVIEW_PROMPT.md` | External verification instructions |
| `REVIEW_RESULTS.json` | Self-review output |

**Key Learning:** If it can't be audited, it can't be claimed.

### Phase 5: Economic Architecture (SEALED)
**Analogy:** Social development — learning boundaries with others

| Artifact | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ECONOMIC_INVARIANTS.md` | Constitutional economic principles |
| `PRICING_LOGIC.md` | Value-based pricing (not exception-based) |
| `LIABILITY_BOUNDARIES.md` | Explicit guarantees and non-guarantees |
| `INCENTIVE_ALIGNMENT.md` | Anti-corruptive incentive structures |

**Key Learning:** Revenue scales within constraints, never by eroding them.

### Phase 6: Role Definitions (COMPLETE)
**Analogy:** Identity formation — learning who does what

| Role | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| EXECUTIVE_AUTHORITY | Strategic direction (Steven) |
| OPERATOR_OF_RECORD | Seals and custody (Phil) |
| AUDITOR | Process witness (Chris) |
| ATTESTOR | Independent verification (Tom) |
| SOVEREIGN_ARCHITECT | Design authority (Andy) |

**Key Learning:** Authority attaches to function, not identity.

### Phases 7–12: Reserved (UNDEFINED)
**Analogy:** Reserved neural capacity — not missing, constitutionally unavailable
**Key Learning:** Undefined ≠ incomplete. Undefined = unavailable for pressure.

### Phase 13: Network Governance (LOCKED)
**Analogy:** Full autonomy gate — execution authority requires explicit unlock
**Status:** LOCKED — no execution authority granted

## Inter-System Wiring (Operational)

Two independent sovereign systems connected via Sealed Packet Protocol:

| System | Status | Phase |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Manus Sandbox | INTACT | 6 COMPLETE |
| Local Node (BLADE2AI) | STABILIZED | 8 ACTIVE |

**Transport:** RSA-2048 signed packets, hash-verified, ledger-logged

---

## Constitutional Invariants (Active)

1.  **Default deny** — halt on ambiguity
2.  **Evidence-first** — no claims without proof
3.  **Dual-key** — no single-point authority
4.  **Volatile containment** — observe without asserting
5.  **Human authority** — final in all cases

The brain development model is complete through Phase 6. Phase 13 remains locked. The system can perceive, inhibit, reason, prove, and interact — but cannot execute autonomously.

**Human authority remains final.**
