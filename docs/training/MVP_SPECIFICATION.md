# MVP Specification: Sovereign AI Governance Training Product

## 1. Overview
A premium, AI-assisted training suite designed to teach organizations and individuals how to build, deploy, and govern "Sovereign AI" systems using the AEGIS architecture (Trinity Format).

## 2. Content Structure
The course is divided into six high-integrity modules:
1. **The Sovereign Mindset**: Philosophical foundations of AI autonomy vs. human agency.
2. **Trinity Architectures**: Designing 3-agent nodes (Investigator, Verifier, Guardian).
3. **Hardened Evidence**: Implementing SHA-256 receipt chains and tamper-evident ledgers.
4. **The Codex Runtime**: Building deterministic governance layers that precede execution.
5. **Kaizen Loops**: Autonomous self-improvement (GembaBot) and drift detection.
6. **Fleet Orchestration**: Scaling to multi-PC, air-gapped, or LAN environments.

## 3. Delivery Platform
- **Primary**: A dedicated Streamlit-based "Boardroom" dashboard (extension of existing AEGIS UI).
- **Secondary**: Cryptographically signed PDF "Codex" manuals for offline study.
- **Interactive**: Integrated "Sandbox" labs where students run actual AEGIS deployment scripts.

## 4. Pricing Strategy
- **Tier 1 (Core)**: $499 - Lifetime access to the digital "Codex" and architecture blueprints.
- **Tier 2 (Pro)**: $1,499 - Includes the "Sandbox" lab environment and 12 months of update manifests.
- **Tier 3 (Enterprise)**: $5,000+ - Custom governance audit and on-site LAN deployment support.

## 5. Automation Level
- **Content Delivery**: 100% automated via the Boardroom portal.
- **Support**: 80% automated via an "Advocate" agent trained on the AEGIS CANON.
- **Verification**: 100% automated; student labs are verified using the system's own `Verify-All.ps1` logic.

## 6. Target Audience
- AI Safety Researchers
- Corporate Compliance Officers
- Independent "Sovereign" Operators
- System Architects for Critical Infrastructure
