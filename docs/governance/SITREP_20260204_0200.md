# SITREP - 2026-02-04 02:00
# ========================

## SYSTEM STATUS: STABILIZED (OK)
## ACTIVE PHASE: 8 (AGI Integration & Road 1234)

### 1. Remediation Summary
*   **Git State**: Synchronized and reconciled (180+ file delta resolved).
*   **Sovereignty**: Remediated at process level. Unjustified egress (Chrome, Edge, Radeon) pruned. OS-level firewall blocked by 'Access Denied' (permissions).
*   **Search Engine**: Enhanced hybrid search (Vector + BM25) fully integrated into Streamlit and Electron.

### 2. Inter-System Wiring (Manus <-> Local Node)
*   **Transport Mechanism**: File-based "Sealed Packet" protocol established in `transport/`.
*   **Cryptographic Identity**: RSA 2048 identity keys generated and verified (`keys/sovereign.key`).
*   **Protocol Scripts**:
    *   `scripts/governance/Send-SealedPacket.ps1`
    *   `scripts/governance/Receive-SealedPacket.ps1`
*   **First Contact**: Dry-run `HEARTBEAT` message successfully signed, transmitted, received, and verified.
*   **Audit**: Both sending and receiving events recorded in the hash-chained `decision_ledger.jsonl`.

### 3. Ledger Status
*   **Entries**: 96
*   **Integrity**: 100% (Verified via `verify_decision_ledger.py`)
*   **Last Event**: `sealed_packet_received` (Packet ID: dce8b46b-...)

## SWOT ANALYSIS

| **STRENGTHS** | **WEAKNESSES** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sealed Trust**: RSA-signed "Sealed Packets" provide machine-verifiable inter-system communication. | **Sovereignty Leakage**: Residual connections in IDE (IntelliJ/VS Code) and system services remain. |
| **Immutable Provenance**: 96-entry ledger ensures a complete, tamper-evident history of all sync/wiring events. | **Permission Constraints**: Lack of local admin prevents full "Default Deny" OS-level enforcement. |

| **OPPORTUNITIES** | **THREATS** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cognitive Integration**: Full "Manus → Local Node" evidence sync can now proceed using sealed transport. | **Audit Sensitivity**: Warning status in sovereignty validator requires manual justification in institutional audits. |
| **Autonomous Scaling**: Road 1234 protocol can now utilize signed attestations for cross-node verification. | **Sync Divergence**: Rapid local changes risk divergence if fleet sync isn't automated. |

**Local Node (BLADE2AI) is operationally aligned and cryptographically prepared for full inter-system conversation wiring.**
