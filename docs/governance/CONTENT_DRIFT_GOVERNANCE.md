# Report: Managing Content Drift and System Integrity

## Context
During content creation and iterative editing, especially with complex governance and technical topics, there is a risk of semantic drift and unintended system impact. This can be exacerbated by cognitive factors such as ADHD, which may cause shifts in focus or scope.

## Key Learnings
1. **Maintain Clear Boundaries**: Always keep core governance content focused and separate from exploratory or extended topics to prevent dilution of purpose.
2. **Explicit Operator Contracts**: Define clear rules for when and how content can be added or modified, ensuring all changes are auditable and reversible.
3. **Use Separate Pages for Experiments**: Isolate experimental or broad conceptual content in dedicated pages to preserve the integrity of primary governance artifacts.
4. **Respect Stillness as Correctness**: Recognize that no change or silence can be a sign of correct governance, avoiding unnecessary edits.
5. **Report Without Impact**: When requested, provide analysis or reports without applying changes to the page, preserving system state.
6. **Iterative Review**: Regularly review content changes for unintended semantic or structural drift, and roll back if necessary to maintain clarity and reliability.
7. **The Rolling Erase Protocol**: Memory edits and the Canonical Register beat historical chat data. Never reach past the current 'Truth' to grab something 'louder' from history.
8. **Scaffolding Ratio**: Monitor the ratio of scaffolding to insight. If the ratio flips (more 'how' than 'what'), the system is overheating.
9. **Pattern over Keywords**: Seek structural patterns (e.g., misaligned incentives) rather than performing repetitive keyword hunting.
10. **Build > Discussion**: In a recovery context, 'asking which to fix' is a consultant loop. The correct behavior is to build/fix, then report.

## Recommendations
- Implement a governance protocol for content updates that includes checkpoints and explicit approval steps.
- Use tooling or manual review to detect semantic drift or scope creep early.
- Encourage clear communication about when content is for discussion versus when it is for page update.
- Provide summary reports or learning transfers as separate outputs without modifying the page unless explicitly authorized.

## Governance Checklist (Pre-Commit)
- [ ] **Rolling Erase Check**: Does this response/edit rely on 'historical' names or platforms explicitly forbidden by the current Memory/Register?
- [ ] **Scaffolding Check**: Is the ratio of structural insight to conversational filler optimal?
- [ ] **Consultant Loop Check**: Am I asking for permission to build something already identified as a requirement?
- [ ] **Incentive Alignment**: Does this recommendation align with the 'Dubai Trust' / Sovereign ownership model (No GDrive/SaaS)?
- [ ] Does this change modify core invariants?
- [ ] Is the scope of this change strictly aligned with the task?
- [ ] Have I avoided "word-smithing" that doesn't add structural value?
- [ ] Is the change documented in the audit trail?
- [ ] Does this edit introduce hidden assumptions?
