## 1. Constitutional Triad (Invariants)
All operations must adhere to these three principles:
1. **Prefer stopping to lying.**
2. **Never optimise away the signal that tells you you're wrong.**
3. **Preserve emergent pattern signal long enough to learn from it.**

## 2. Organizational Structure
- **Andy Jones** — Founder & Executive
- **Steven Jones** — CEO / POA
- **Chris Bevan** — COO
- **Kelly Pawlett** — Tenerife GM
- **Tom Maher** — Programme Director

## 3. Financial & IP Framework
- **Dubai Trust:** Structure for Intellectual Property holdings.
- **Traded Ltd Entity:** Operational and trading arm.

The following directory structure is mandated for the Tresorit deployment:
- `00-GOVERNANCE`
- `01-ARCHITECTURE`
- `02-OPERATIONS`
- `03-CVA`
- `04-LEDGER`
- `05-LEGAL`

## 5. Governance Constraints
- **Anti-Drift:** "Memory edits are canonical truth. Old chat history is artefact only."

- **Exclusion:** No references to removed personnel (Owen).
