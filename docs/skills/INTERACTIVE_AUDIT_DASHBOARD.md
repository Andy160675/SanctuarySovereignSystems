# SKILL: Interactive Audit Dashboard

## Overview
The Interactive Audit Dashboard is a reusable architectural pattern for visualizing and orchestrating documentation audits using a "Backward Audit Model". It applies Cross-Validation Architecture (CVA) principles reflexively to the system's own evolution.

## Pattern: Interactive Verification Lab
Instead of static audit reports, the system provides a live control surface where:
1. **Historical Lineage** is reconstructed from cryptographic anchors and commit logs.
2. **Forensic Artefacts** are searchable and hash-verified.
3. **Audit Gaps** are surfaced as high-signal metrics rather than buried in logs.
4. **Audit Pipelines** can be triggered on-demand to refresh the system's self-awareness.

## Implementation Details
- **Frontend**: Streamlit-based web interface for accessibility and rapid prototyping.
- **Data Layer**: Direct consumption of `JSON` and `Markdown` artifacts generated by the audit ensemble.
- **Orchestration**: Integration with PowerShell-based audit scripts (`Invoke-AuditPipeline.ps1`).

## Components
- `Audit_Dashboard.py`: The core dashboard implementation.
- `docs/audit/`: Canonical storage for audit artifacts.
- `scripts/audit/`: specialized audit agents (Forensic Scanner, Timeline Builder, etc.).

## Usage in Sovereign Systems
This skill ensures that "Governance as an Asset" is observable and verifiable. It upholds the meta-rule: *Never optimise away the signal that tells you you are wrong* by explicitly highlighting evidence gaps.

## Reusability
This pattern can be applied to any system requiring high-integrity provenance tracking by:
1. Defining the audit ensemble (agents).
2. Standardizing the output artifact schema (Timeline, Artefact Map).
3. Pointing the Dashboard at the artifact directory.
